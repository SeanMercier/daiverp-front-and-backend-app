worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of
the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
Works a copy of this License; and</p>

distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the

implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions

<p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>

Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of
the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding
those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
construed as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
<p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the
trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
the NOTICE file.</p>
<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
under this License.</p>
<p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Legal Code</p>
<p>CC0 1.0 Universal</p>
<p>CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT
CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES
THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR
WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER.</p>
<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
(defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and
all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a
database (each, a "Work").</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a
Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,
cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can
reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build
upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as
freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture
and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work
in part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he
or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0
may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse
of data in a Work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
the legal protection of databases, and under any national
implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
of such directive); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementations thereof.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit
of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any
part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not
(i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes
of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p>
<div class="orderedlist">

<li>
<p>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this

<p>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
use of the Work.</p>

<p>Portions of this software are derived from third-party works
licensed under terms compatible with the above MIT license:</p>
<p>The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright &copy; 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and
licensed under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source
files). The included version has been heavily modified by Rich
Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace
cleanliness.</p>
<p>Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*)
is</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2011 David Schultz or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2008 Stephen L. Moshier</p>
<p>and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files.
All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.</p>
<p>The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright
&copy; 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a
two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on
Android.</p>
<p>The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright &copy; 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD
license.</p>
<p>The implementation of blowfish crypt
(src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar
Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes
with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that
may not recognize the public domain.</p>
<p>The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright
&copy; 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style
license.</p>
<p>The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was
adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during
upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT
terms.</p>
<p>The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and
is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard
Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer.
It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>All other files which have no copyright comments are original
works produced specifically for use as part of this library,
written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or
by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of
individual files can be found in the git version control history of
the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each
file is in the interest of source tree size.</p>
<p>In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header
files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be
linked into applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and
arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission
notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files
without any requirement of attribution. These files include
substantial contributions from:</p>
<p>Bobby Bingham</p>
<p>John Spencer</p>
<p>Nicholas J. Kain</p>
<p>Rich Felker</p>
<p>Richard Pennington</p>
<p>Stefan Kristiansson</p>
<p>Szabolcs Nagy</p>
<p>all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.</p>
<p>This file previously contained text expressing a belief that
most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently
trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over
whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the
spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues
being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.</p>
